### Idea

The idea of making such an app came to me after watching ["The Social Network"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/) movie. Where Mark Zuckerberg gets pissed off by his ex girlfriend and, being a little bit drunk, creates FaceSmash, a web-app that allows to compare Harvard girls between each other, two at a time. 

I was not pissed by my ex, nor was I drunk, but decided to reimplement this app using Python as a backend language for my Flask Server and JS/HTML/CSS for my pages. Being a HSE student I have decided to use VK society for getting the profile pages of the girls from my university.
